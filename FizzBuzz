/**
FizzBuzz in Javascript
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

//fizz buzz
//print 1 to 100
//print "Fizz" for #s divisible by 3
//print "Buzz" for #s divisible by 5 (and not 3)
//print "FizzBuzz" for #s divisible by both 3 and 5

for (var i=1; i<=100; i++){
	if ((i%3===0)&&(i%5===0)){
    console.log("number: " + "FizzBuzz");
  }
	if (i%3===0){
    console.log("number: " + "Fizz");
  }else if (i%5===0){
    console.log("number: " + "Buzz");
  }else{
    console.log("number: " + i);
  }	
}//end forloop
